          <p>We had some damp and repointing work done by Steve and felt it was excellent . He was very adaptable to the problems our old crumbling Edwardian terrace house presented, having to rebuild parts from the inside out. Steve is very tenacious when it comes to finding the route of the problem. The front was to be re- rendered. Steve found the original brick underneath which was in good enough condition to be cleaned up and re pointed instead, that proved a better choice for the building. Steve's point work is very smart and proficient. He is a really hard worker and conscious in his approach. I felt Steve was always very honest and straight up in what the problem was, how it could be fixed and if he felt he was the right person to do it. I really trust his opinion . Steve was also very clean and tidy and mindful of how his work could affect your day-to-day living, cleaning up at the end of the day. I also really appreciated how when he started a job he saw it through in a set time. I feel Steve has a sense of pride in what he does and wants his customers to be happy in the service and end result, and we are. We will definitely ask Steve to do any future jobs our house needs.</p>

          <p>Steve rendered an outside wall for us. He was very professional, he arrived when he said he would, gave us a good quote for the work to be done and Steve carried out the whole job very efficiently. The standard of his workmanship is excellent and he was always polite. Steve also tiled a shower room for us whilst working for another tradesman in 2012 and he finished the work to a wonderfully high standard. I would recommend him to anyone.</p>
